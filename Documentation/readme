The Polaris M744 is very similar to the Peugeot/Citroen M744 - Notable differences of the Citroen M744 include the lack of a Wideband O2 controller IC and the inclusion of a narrowband O2 input. 

There may be other differences not yet identified. 

Wideband can still (and should) be used on the Citroen M744 with the aid of an external wideband controller / gauge.
